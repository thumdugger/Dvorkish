# Dvorkish
Custom Phonetic-ish Russian keyboard layout based on a US Dvorak layout.

Why "Dvorkish"?  Well, it isn't quite Dvorak now is it?

No?  Ok.  The more detailed answer is that I have used Dvorak keyboard layouts for years.  At some point I somehow convinced myself that learning Russian would be "A Good Thing".  Not that long after that convincing I found myself getting frustrated by the enormous number of *Simultaneous Things* that one finds one is suddenly required to learn when learning a language new to said one.

Being impulsive and easily distracted I, of course, set out almost immediately to lighten the "must learn" load.  Since Russian keyboards are completely different than anything I touch type on I decided this was one area I could optimize a bit.

After looking around at various other attempts at the same thing it became clear to me that my primal Developer Instincts could not be ignored any longer.  In short I needed to throw "reuse" out the window and create my own solution from the ground up.  I quelled the weaker pieces of my non-Developer soul by simply reminding them that all the other folks' solutions we had run through probably followed the exact same path.

And thus, "Dvorkish", a name that somehow reminds me of orks, which makes it, somehow, even more awesome than the awesome that all of this already is, was born.
